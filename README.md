* Installed `yarn global add typescript`.
* Installed `yarn global add concurrently`.
* Installed `yarn global add nodemon`.

* `yarn run serve` uses `nodemon` to watch `./dist/` and run

* Using `koa` (next generation of Express).
    * Using `koa-router` and `koa-bodyparser`.

* Setup `typeorm` and migrations.
* Setup `tslint` (still must run `yarn run tslint --fix`)...
  * But can install `tslint` for VSCode so that this auto highlights...

* How can I best specify whether a property should be in params?
* I want to add React in.
* I want to add Next.
* I want to look into GraphQL.
